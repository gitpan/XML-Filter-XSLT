XML::Filter::XSLT
=================

A simple XSLT SAX2 filter. It uses any available XSLT processor
on your system that we can use in some SAXy way. Currently this
is just XML::LibXSLT (which we use to build a DOM tree), but we
expect more processors will be added over time.

INSTALLATION:

 $ perl Makefile.PL
 $ make
 $ make test
 $ su
